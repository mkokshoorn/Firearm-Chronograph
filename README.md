# Firearm Chronograph

Engineering design-only project giving detailed specification report for a proposed firearm chronograph. Chronographs are used to determine the muzzle velocity of firearm ammunition. They are used by hunting hobbyists and competitors to ensure a firearm in operating safely and efficiently within legal limits.  The full details can be seen in DesignReport.pdf. 


## Proposed Approach

The approach proposed using two laser diodes-sensor pairs based on the end of the firearm. The muzzle velocity could be determined by the difference in time between each beam being broken.
